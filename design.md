The LordOfTheRingsAPI class provides an interface for consuming the "Lord of the Rings" API. This class is designed to make it easy for developers to make requests to the API and handle the response data.

The class is implemented in Swift and uses the URLSession class from the Foundation framework to make HTTP requests. It also conforms to the Networking protocol, which defines a single request method that can be used to make a request to a specified URL with the specified HTTP method and parameters.

The LordOfTheRingsAPI class has five instance methods, each of which corresponds to a different endpoint on the "Lord of the Rings" API. These methods are:

fetchBooks: fetches a list of books from the API.
fetchBook(withID:): fetches a single book by its ID.
fetchMovies: fetches a list of movies from the API.
fetchChapters(forBookWithID:): fetches the chapters for a given book by its ID.
fetchMovie(withID:): fetches a single movie by its ID.
fetchQuotes(forMovieWithID:): fetches the quotes for a given movie by its ID.
Each of these methods takes a completion block as its final parameter, which is called with the result of the request. The result is either a success, containing the decoded response data, or a failure, containing an error.

In summary, the LordOfTheRingsAPI class provides an easy-to-use interface for making requests to the "Lord of the Rings" API and handling the response data. It is designed to be simple to use and flexible enough to support the various endpoints exposed by the API.
